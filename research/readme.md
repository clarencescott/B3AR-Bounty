# 📘 **Research Folder – Overview**

This directory contains my ongoing cybersecurity research, focused on **public‑facing, non‑intrusive observations** of small business and SOHO network environments. The goal is to document real‑world security risks that are visible from the outside and help organizations understand how to reduce exposure without requiring deep penetration testing.

All research here follows strict ethical guidelines and is intended for **education, awareness, and defensive improvement**.

## 🔍 **What This Folder Includes**
- Case studies of publicly visible network risks  
- Research papers on SOHO and small‑business security  
- Documentation of common misconfigurations  
- Public‑facing asset observations  
- Wi‑Fi broadcast and exposure analysis  
- Web and service metadata reviews  
- Non‑intrusive testing notes and methodologies  

No exploitation, credential testing, or internal access is ever performed.

## 🧭 **Purpose of This Research**
Small businesses and SOHO networks often face:
- Misconfigured routers  
- Exposed admin interfaces  
- Weak Wi‑Fi setups  
- Outdated firmware  
- Publicly visible services  
- Poor segmentation  
- Unsafe guest networks  

This research helps highlight those risks in a **safe, responsible, and accessible** way.

## 🛡️ **Ethical Guidelines**
All research in this directory adheres to:

- **Public‑only testing**  
- **No exploitation**  
- **No bypassing authentication**  
- **No scanning beyond light, non‑intrusive enumeration**  
- **No accessing private data**  
- **No disruption of services**  
- **Responsible disclosure when appropriate**  

This work is strictly for awareness and defensive improvement.
